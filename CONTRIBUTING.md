class MyCustomPlugin(BasePlugin):
    def __init__(self, plugin_id, config=None):
        super().__init__(plugin_id, config)
    
    def load(self):
        # Initialize your plugin
        self.is_loaded = True
        return True
    
    def unload(self):
        # Cleanup
        self.is_loaded = False
        return True
    
    def process(self, data):
        # Process data
        return processed_result
```
